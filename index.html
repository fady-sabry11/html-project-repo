      font-weight: 400;">What is an operating system?</h1>
      
      <p>An <b> operating system </b>is the most important software that runs on a computer. It <br>
         manages the computer's <b> memory </b> and <b> processes</b>, as well as all of its <b> software </b> and <br>
         <b> hardware</b>. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how <br>
         to speak the computer's language. <b>Without an operating system, a computer is <br>
         useless</b>.

      <h2 style="color: #4E4E4E;
      font-weight: 400;">The operating system's job</h2>
      <p> Your computer's <b>operating system (OS)</b> manages all of the <b>software</b> and <b>hardware</b> on <br>
          the computer. Most of the time, there are several different computer programs running <br>
           at the same time, and they all need to access your computer's <b>central processing unit <br>
           (CPU)</b>, <b>memory</b>, and <b>storage</b>. The operating system coordinates all of this to make sure <br>
           each program gets what it needs.
      </p> <br>

      <h2 style="color: #4E4E4E;
      font-weight: 400;">Types of operating systems</h2>
      <p> Operating systems usually come <b>pre-loaded</b> on any computer you buy. Most people use <br>
          the operating system that comes with their computer, but it's possible to upgrade or <br>
          even change operating systems. The three most common operating systems for <br>
          personal computers are: 
          <ul>
            <li><b>Microsoft Windows</b></li>
            <li><b>macOS</b></li> 
            <li><b>Linux</b></li>
          </ul> 
      </p>
      <p> Modern operating systems use a <b>graphical user interface</b>, or <b>GUI</b> (pronounced <b>gooey</b>). <br>
         A GUI lets you use your mouse to click <b>icons</b>, <b>buttons</b>, and <b>menus</b>, and everything is <br>
         clearly displayed on the screen using a combination of <b>graphics</b> and <b>text</b>.

      width="644" height="360">

      <p> Each operating system's GUI has a different look and feel, so if you switch to a different <br>
         operating system it may seem unfamiliar at first. However, modern operating systems <br>
         are designed to be <b>easy to use</b>, and most of the basic principles are the same.

         Microsoft Windows
      </h1>

      <p>Microsoft created the <b>Windows</b> operating system in the mid-1980s. There have been <br>
         many different versions of Windows, but the most recent ones are <b>Windows 10</b> (released <br>
         in 2015), <b>Windows 8</b> (2012), <b>Windows 7</b> (2009), and <b>Windows Vista</b> (2007).Windows <br>
         comes <b>pre-loaded</b> on most new PCs, which helps to make it the <b>most popular <br>
         operating system</b> in the world.
      </p>

      <h1 style="color: #4E4E4E;
      font-weight: 400;">macOS</h1>
      <p> <b>macOS</b> (previously called <b>OS X</b>) is a line of operating systems created by Apple. It comes <br>
         preloaded on all Macintosh computers, or Macs. Some of the specific versions include <br>
         <b>Mojave</b> (released in 2018), <b>High Sierra</b> (2017), and <b>Sierra</b> (2016).
      </p>
      <p> According to <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/" style=" color: #324698; font-weight: 700;
         text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">StatCounter Global Stats</a>, macOS users account for less than <b>10%</b> of <br>
         global operating systemsâ€”much lower than the percentage of Windows users (more <br>
         than <b>80%</b>). One reason for this is that Apple computers tend to be more expensive. <br>
         However, many people do prefer the look and feel of macOS over Windows.

      <h1 style="color: #4E4E4E;
      font-weight: 400;">Linux</h1>
      <p> <b>Linux</b> (pronounced <b>LINN-ux</b>) is a family of <b>open-source</b> operating systems, which <br>
         means they can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world. This is <br>
         different from <b>proprietary software</b> like Windows, which can only be modified by the <br>
         company that owns it. The advantages of Linux are that it is <b>free</b>, and there are many <br>
         different <b>distributions</b>&ndash;or versions&ndash;you can choose from.
      </p>
      <p> According to <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/" style=" color: #324698; font-weight: 700;
         text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">StatCounter Global Stats</a>,  Linux users account for less than <b>2%</b> of global <br>
         operating systems. However, most <b>servers</b> run Linux because it's relatively <br>
         easy to customize.
      </p>

      <h1 style="color: #4E4E4E;
      font-weight: 400;">Operating systems for mobile devices</h1>
      <p>The operating systems we've been talking about so far were designed to run on <b>desktop</b> <br>
         and <b>laptop</b> computers. <b>Mobile devices</b> such as <b>phones</b>, <b>tablet computers</b>, and <b>MP3 <br>
         players</b> are different from desktop and laptop computers, so they run operating systems <br>
         that are designed specifically for mobile devices. Examples of mobile operating systems <br>
         include <b>Apple iOS</b> and <b>Google Android</b>. In the screenshot below, you can see iOS <br>
         running on an iPad.
      </p>
      <img src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e069691496fdb039ceeecb_01_17_2014/understanding_os_mobile_01682.jpg" alt="4klha bazet"
      width="644" height="360">
      <p>Operating systems for mobile devices generally aren't as fully featured as those made for <br>
         desktop and laptop computers, and they aren't able to run all of the same software. <br>
         However, you can still do a lot of things with them, like watch movies, browse the Web, <br>
         manage your calendar, and play games.
