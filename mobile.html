       <p>
         A mobile device is a general term for any type of <b>handheld computer</b>. These devices are <br>
         designed to be extremely portable, and they can often fit in your hand. Some mobile <br>
         devices—like <b>tablets</b>, <b>e-readers</b>, and <b>smartphones</b>—are powerful enough to do many <br>
         of the same things you can do with a desktop or laptop computer.

       <h2 style="color: #4E4E4E;
       font-weight: 400;">Tablet computers</h2>
         
       <p>
         Like laptops, <b>tablet computers</b> are designed to be portable. However, they provide a <br>
         different computing experience. The most obvious difference is that tablet computers <br>
         don't have keyboards or touchpads. Instead, the entire screen is touch-sensitive, <br>
         allowing you to type on a <b>virtual keyboard</b> and use your finger as a mouse pointer.
       </p>

       width="644" height="360">
       <p>
         Tablet computers can't necessarily do everything traditional computers can do. For <br>
         many people, a traditional computer like a <b>desktop</b> or <b>laptop</b> is still needed in order to <br>
         use some programs. However, the convenience of a tablet computer means it may be <br>
         ideal as a <b>second computer</b>.

       <h2 style="color: #4E4E4E;
       font-weight: 400;">E-readers</h2>

       <p>
          <b>E-book readers</b>—also called <b>e-readers</b>—are similar to tablet computers, except they are <br>
          mainly designed for reading <b>e-books</b> (digital, downloadable books). Notable examples <br>
          include the <b>Amazon Kindle</b>, <b>Barnes & Noble Nook</b>, and <b>Kobo</b>. Most e-readers use an <br>
          <b>e-ink</b> display, which is easier to read than a traditional computer display. You can even <br>
          read in bright sunlight, just like if you were reading a regular book.
         </p>

       <h2 style="color: #4E4E4E;
       font-weight: 400;">Smartphones</h2>

       <p>
         A smartphone is a more powerful version of a traditional cell phone. In addition to the <br>
         same basic features—phone calls, voicemail, text messaging—smartphones can <b>connect <br>
         to the Internet</b> over Wi-Fi or a cellular network (which requires purchasing a monthly <br>
         <b>data plan</b>). This means you can use a smartphone for the same things you would <br>
         normally do on a computer, such as checking your email, browsing the Web, <br>
         or shopping online.
       </p>

       width="355px" style="margin: auto; display: block;">
       <br>

       <p>
         Most smartphones use a <b>touch-sensitive screen</b>, meaning there isn't a physical <br>
         keyboard on the device. Instead, you'll type on a virtual keyboard and use your fingers to <br>
         interact with the display. Other standard features include a high-quality digital camera <br>
         and the ability to play digital music and video files. For many people, a smartphone can <br>
         actually replace electronics like an old laptop, digital music player, and digital camera <br>
         in the same device.
